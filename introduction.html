            Some of my skills include profeciency in the languages of html, css, java, c++, and python. I have been working in IT for almost 5 years now so
            I also have a lot of experience in that field and in tech support.

        <h1 style="color: blue">Hobbies</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'">
            I have a big interest in game design (probably the computer science field I am the most interested in) so one of my hobbies is playing video games.
            Whenever I try to learn a language, what inspires me the most to keep at the language is if I can use that language to make a video game.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'">
            I also like watching anime and reading manga in my spare time. I don't have much spare time but when I'm not studying or working or playing video games
            I'm either watching anime or reading manga.
